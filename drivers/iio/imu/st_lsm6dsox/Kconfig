	  Enable support to loading MLC binary for internal hw machine learning
	  core. The configuration code is loaded via the firmware support upload
	  the file st_lsm6dsox_mlc.bin in / etc / firmware

	  The binary configuration code must be generated using the ST UNICO tool

	  Select yes if you want to preload some examples on machine learning core
	  and finite state machine.

	  The examples code is a 6D position recognition and is hardcoded in the
	  driver in the mlcdata structure.

	  Select yes if you want to enable wake-up feature embedded into the driver.
	  Enabling this option the driver can wake-up the application processor by
	  using the irq line.

	  By default during suspend mode all enabled senrors are set in power down
	  mode to reduce the power consumption.

	  Select yes if you want to enable support to voltage regulator to power up/down
	  the sensor.
	  Add the vdd-supply and vddio-supply entries into device tree to
	  automatically manage the sensor power supply.
