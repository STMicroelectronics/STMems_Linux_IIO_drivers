	  Say yes here to build support for STMicroelectronics LSM6DSO32X imu
	  sensor.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called st_lsm6dso32x.

	help
	  Enable support to loading MLC binary for internal hw machine learning
	  core. The configuration code is loaded via the firmware support upload
	  the file st_lsm6dso32x_mlc.bin in / etc / firmware

	  The binary configuration code must be generated using the ST UNICO tool
	  application

	depends on IIO_ST_LSM6DSO32X_MLC
	help
	  Select yes if you want to preload some examples on machine learning core
	  and finite state machine.

	  The examples code is a 6D position recognition and is hardcoded in the
	  driver in the mlcdata structure.

config IIO_ST_LSM6DSO32X_MAY_WAKEUP
	bool "Enable wake-up irq"
	depends on IIO_ST_LSM6DSO32X
	help
	  Select yes if you want to enable wake-up feature embedded into the driver.
	  Enabling this option the driver can wake-up the application processor by
	  using the irq line.

	  By default during suspend mode all enabled senrors are set in power down
	  mode to reduce the power consumption.

config IIO_ST_LSM6DSO32X_EN_REGULATOR
	bool "Enable support to voltage regulator"
	depends on IIO_ST_LSM6DSO32X
	help
	  Select yes if you want to enable support to voltage regulator to power up/down
	  the sensor.
	  Add the vdd-supply and vddio-supply entries into device tree to
	  automatically manage the sensor power supply.
